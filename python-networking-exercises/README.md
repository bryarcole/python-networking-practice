# Python Networking Practice Exercises

This project contains a series of exercises designed to help you practice and improve your networking skills using Python. The exercises range from basic socket programming to more advanced networking concepts.

## Project Structure

- `exercises/`: Contains the exercise files with instructions and skeleton code
- `solutions/`: Contains the reference solutions for each exercise
- `data/`: Additional data files needed for some exercises

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Work through the exercises in order, as they build on each other

## Exercises Overview

1. **Basic Socket Programming**: Create a simple client-server application
2. **HTTP Client**: Implement HTTP GET, POST requests using the requests library
3. **RESTful API Interaction**: Interact with a RESTful API
4. **Web Scraping**: Extract data from web pages
5. **Simple Web Server**: Create a basic HTTP server
6. **URL Shortener**: Build a simple URL shortening service
7. **Chat Application**: Implement a simple chat using sockets
8. **Network Scanner**: Create a tool to scan network ports
9. **Asynchronous Networking**: Use asyncio for concurrent network operations
10. **File Transfer Protocol**: Implement a basic file transfer system

## Learning Path

Each exercise has its own README with specific instructions and expected outcomes. Start with exercise 1 and progress through them in order. If you get stuck, refer to the solution files, but try to solve the exercises on your own first.

Have fun learning Python networking!
