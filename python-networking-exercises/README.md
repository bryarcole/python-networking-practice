# Python Networking Practice Exercises

This project contains a series of exercises designed to help you practice and improve your networking skills using Python. The exercises range from basic socket programming to more advanced networking concepts.

## Project Structure

- `exercises/`: Contains the exercise files with instructions and skeleton code
- `solutions/`: Contains the reference solutions for each exercise
- `data/`: Additional data files needed for some exercises

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Work through the exercises in order, as they build on each other

## Exercises Overview

### Application-Level Networking
1. **Basic Socket Programming**: Create a simple client-server application
2. **HTTP Client**: Implement HTTP GET, POST requests using the requests library
3. **RESTful API Interaction**: Interact with a RESTful API
4. **Web Scraping**: Extract data from web pages
5. **Simple Web Server**: Create a basic HTTP server
6. **URL Shortener**: Build a simple URL shortening service
7. **Chat Application**: Implement a simple chat using sockets

### Lower-Level Networking
8. **Network Scanner**: Create a tool to scan network ports and hosts
9. **Packet Sniffer**: Capture and analyze network packets
10. **Subnet Calculator**: Work with IP addresses and subnet calculations
11. **Traceroute Implementation**: Implement a traceroute utility
12. **DNS Client**: Build a DNS client to perform lookups

## Learning Path

Each exercise has its own README with specific instructions and expected outcomes. Start with exercise 1 and progress through them in order. If you get stuck, refer to the solution files, but try to solve the exercises on your own first.

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise consists of:
- A README file explaining the concepts and tasks
- Template Python files with TODO comments to guide implementation
- Clear objectives and expected outcomes
- Bonus challenges for additional learning

## Requirements

The exercises use various Python libraries for networking tasks. Key libraries include:
- socket (built-in): For low-level networking
- requests: For HTTP operations
- scapy: For packet manipulation and analysis
- flask: For web applications
- beautifulsoup4: For web scraping
- asyncio: For asynchronous networking

For a complete list, see requirements.txt.

Have fun learning Python networking!
